// Package etcdtest connects integration tests to a real etcd, giving each test
// a key space of its own.
//
// The three integration suites (pkg/arena, pkg/metadata, pkg/scrub, plus the
// IPC datapath) all run against one etcd, and `go test ./...` runs their
// binaries in parallel.  Sharing the real key space meant they deleted and
// recreated each other's inodes mid-run: a guard test failing on a missing
// inode, a scrub test finding its extents already reclaimed as orphans.  Both
// read as product bugs and are not.
//
// Every client here is wrapped in an etcd namespace derived from the test's
// name, so no two tests — in one package or across parallel binaries — can see
// each other's keys, and the cleanup is a single prefix delete.
